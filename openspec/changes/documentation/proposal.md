  - Usage examples and command reference
  - Prerequisites (GitHub CLI, Rust toolchain, OpenSpec CLI)
  - Architecture section explaining tool internals and OpenSpec methodology
  - License information
- Create CONTRIBUTING.md with:
  - Development setup instructions
  - OpenSpec-Driven Development guidelines
  - AI-Generated Code policy
  - Testing, code style, and workflow guidelines

## Capabilities

### New Capabilities
